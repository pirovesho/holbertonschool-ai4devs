## Phase 1 - Short-Term: Stabilization & Assessment
- Conduct full code audit to identify legacy and risky components.
- Document key modules using AI-assisted explanations.
- Introduce automated testing for critical paths.

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Limited automated testing coverage**: May miss edge cases → Mitigation: prioritize high-impact modules first.
- **Global state reliance**: Could cause unpredictable behavior during refactor → Mitigation: isolate modules and use mocks in tests.

---

## Phase 2 - Medium-Term: Incremental Refactoring
- Refactor WP_Query and metadata handling into smaller, testable components.
- Standardize coding practices (PSR compliance, linting).
- Modularize plugin hooks to reduce tight coupling.

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Changes may affect response times → Mitigation: benchmark before/after and implement caching.
- **Inconsistent coding standards**: Can slow development → Mitigation: enforce style guides and code reviews.

---

## Phase 3 - Long-Term: Modern Architecture
- Introduce dependency injection and reduce global variables.
- Migrate key components to modern PHP features (typed properties, namespaces).
- Optionally split into microservices for high-load modules (REST API, metadata).

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Plugin security vulnerabilities**: New architecture may break plugin compatibility → Mitigation: thorough testing, security scanning.
- **Complexity in migration**: Long-term refactor may introduce new bugs → Mitigation: adopt Strangler pattern for incremental replacement and continuous integration.
